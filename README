We'd like to thank the academy...
===============================================================================

A big thanks goes out to Keith Wood for his jQuery SVG library, which is used
in Cytoscape Web's default SVG renderer implementation.  You can find out more
about his library at his website (http://keith-wood.name/svg.html).



Build dependencies
===============================================================================

You need the following installed in order to build successfully.

	* make
	* java >= 1.5 (for YUI compressor)
	* rm
	* cat
	* cp
	* zip
	* mv
	* printf
	
Their paths are defined in `Makefile`, so you can revise the paths to these
executables and still run `make` successfully.  You should be able to run
`make` without modification on any well configured Unix-like machine, such as
Linux or Mac OS X.



Build instructions
===============================================================================

Run `make` in the console.  The targets are:

	all : build everything (default)
	minify : build the production minified JS
	zip : minify and make a ZIP file for release
	clean : deletes built files

A note to developers:

For `zip`, make sure to define `VERSION` in `Makefile` if you're making an
actual release ZIP.

In the `Makefile`, you can specify the JS files to include in the built ZIP in
the `JSFILES` variable.  The order you specify there is the same as the order
the files are included in the all.min.js file.  Order your dependencies 
accordingly.



Tests
===============================================================================

QUnit tests are found in the `tests` directory.  Each HTML file shares the
test suite but redefines which JS files are used.  In this way, you can test
with different versions of jQuery or different falvours of the library
(minified, plain, or combined and minified).
